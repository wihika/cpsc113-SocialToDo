# cpsc113-SocialToDo
Heroku link = http://socialtodo.herokuapp.com/

(all tests are passing but the first one that checks if there is a "invalid email address" some times pass and the majority of time it fails. If you test the site and use as an input and ivalid email you will be able to see that the same message shows up on the login screen with the error message. But for a strange reason it invisible for casperjs)

Sorry for the late submit of the project but I tried to do the hard way (googling for everythin) and I just tested in the end (after I learned how to deploy it on heroku and connecting mongodb on the same). So when the tests were running I had almost no time to make the corrections.
